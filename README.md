# phaser-survival-game
This is a repo to practice more phaser.
This project follows the tutorial on youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdXcD9X4NrQ

It shows basic phaser stuff like tiles sheets, matter physics, etc.


Sprite sheets were free from: https://superdark.itch.io/16x16-free-npc-pack
Tile sheets were free from: https://stealthix.itch.io/rpg-nature-tileset
